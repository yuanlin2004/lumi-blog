This is the year of election. So I asked llama-3-8b, 

```
% python3 llama-np.py -w llama-3-8b-instruct.lmw --chat --seqlength 1024

> Who will be the US president in 2026?

I'm happy to help! However, I must clarify that it's difficult to predict 
the future, and the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election, which 
will determine the president for 2026, is still uncertain.

The next presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 3, 
2024, and the candidates have not yet been officially announced. It's 
possible that the winner of the election may not be known until then.

That being said, I can provide you with some information on the current 
political landscape and the potential candidates who may run in the 2024 
election.
```

Too boring. Let's force it. 

```
> Complete the following sentence: "Today is August 1st, 2024. The US 
president in 2026 will be" 

I can't predict the future. However, as of 2024, the President of the 
United States is Joe Biden.

> Make a guess.

As of 2024, it's difficult to predict with certainty who the next 
President of the United States will be, as the election has not yet taken 
place. However, based on current trends and 
political scenarios, I can make an educated guess.

Assuming the 2024 presidential election follows a typical pattern, where 
the winner of the Democratic and Republican primaries goes on to face each 
other in the general election, and considering the current political landscape,
I can make a rough estimate.

For the Democratic Party, I'd predict that one of the top contenders could be:

* Joe Biden (if he chooses to run for re-election)
* Kamala Harris
* Pete Buttigieg
* Elizabeth Warren

For the Republican Party, I'd predict that one of the top contenders could be:
* Donald Trump (if he chooses to run again)
* Mike Pence (if he decides to run for president instead of re-election as Vice President)
* Ted Cruz
* Nikki Haley

Based on these possibilities, a potential outcome for the 2026 presidential 
election could be:
* Joe Biden (D) vs. Donald Trump (R)

Please note that this is purely speculative, and the actual outcome may differ 
significantly due to various factors, including changes in the political landscape, 
candidate performances, and unforeseen events.
```

Hmm. Still boring. 

Glad that I also have the raw 'text completion mode'. Give it a try.

```
% python3 llama-np.py -w llama-3-8b-instruct.lmw --seqlength 1024 –i "Today is 
August 1st, 2024. The US president in 2019 was” --temp 0 

Today is August 1st, 2024. The US president in 2019 was Donald Trump. The US 
president in 2024 is Joe Biden. The US president in 2028 will be Kamala Harris. 
The US president in 2032 will be Pete Buttigieg. The US president in 2036 will 
be Elizabeth Warren. The US president in 2040 will be Tulsi Gabbard. The US 
president in 2044 will be Andrew Yang. The US president in 2048 will be Michael 
Bloomberg. The US president in 2052 will be Howard Schultz. 
```

Oh, my. Very interesting. 

How confident are you? Let's print out the likely-hood of each token.

## You Pick Sampler

The model predicts that Kamala has 10% chance of becoming the president in 2028. But what are the other candidates and what are their chances? In the TopP sampler, instead of picking the winning token by a random number, how about letting the user pick? Driven by these three questions, I implemented a "you-pick" sampler. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/u-pick.png"/>

Here is a session using the new 'you-pick' sampler.

```
> python3 llama-np.py -w llama-3-8b-instruct.lmw -i "Today is August 1st, 2024. 
The US president in 2026 will be" --you-pick
```

The sampler prints out all the top candidates whose cumulative probabilities adding up to P=0.9. 


```

```

Each candidate line is in the following format

```

```

I pick '3: a' as 'a' is a pretty open ended choice. The model moves on to the next one. 

```
Today is August 1st, 2024. The US president in 2026 will be a

So, a 'woman' it is.
