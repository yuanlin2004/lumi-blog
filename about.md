`lumi` is an umbrella project that I use to teach myself the fundamentals of deep learning and explore new ideas. Just for fun.

> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.

The project consists of two components
1. a code and document [repo](https://github.com/yuanlin2004/lumi), some may find the change history useful too.
2. a [blog series](https://yuanlin2004.github.io/lumi-blog) which tell stories, lessons and learnings that cannot be easily conveyed by code and documents.

This is the blog.
