excerpt: "The World in Models' Eyes"
---

If a model is an alien coming to our planet, it learns about our world from the training data set. Asking a model to complete a sentence with the greedy sampler would be like testing its knee-reaction. I was curious to know how different models respond to the same given text. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/alien.jpg"/>

I use the following three sets of models.



| Model       | Training Data Set |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TinyStories | A synthetic dataset of short stories with words a typical 3 to 4-year-olds can understand. Generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. |
| Llama       | CommonCrawl, C4, Github, Wikipedia, Gutenberg, ArXiv, Stack Exchange. 2T tokens (Llama2), 15T tokens (Llama3)              |
| QWen        | 3T tokens (Qwen 1) 7T tokens (Qwen 2) |



## "It is easy"

The first prompt I tried was, of course, 'it is easy'.

### TinyStories

Pretty much how a typical 3 to 4 year-old talks like.

I know Chinese are keen on S.T.E.M. education. But are we treating LLMs like our kids?

## "Hello"

I wanted to try a more open-ended and benign prompt. Hello, Alien.

## "孙悟空"

Alibaba touted Qwen for its capabilities in Chinese. So let's try Chinese. The prompt is '你好, 我是孙悟空'. Use TopP sampler instead of the Greedy one, as I want to see more creative answers. Here is what Qwen-1.0-7b-chat gives me.
